          Last month, my wife, Anne Doe, took me to Las Vegas because she had to
          go for a business convention. Needless to say, she writes for an guide
          to casinos and I hate gambling. But then, she likes it and this
          supports us too, so I went along without any hassle. At first I was
          depressed, but then as I asked around and looked around, I ended up
          having more fun in Las Vegas than I would have thought. And no. I did
          not enter a single casino while I was there.

          One of the greatest things about Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City
          (but especially Las Vegas) is the number of shows that are available.
          You can get to watch top class comedians like Jay Leno, Jerry
          Seinfeld, Ray Romano, Tim Allen and even the likes of Bill Cosby and
          Chris Rock. If you are into music you can watch female singers like
          Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and
          Beyonc?, male performers like Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Snoopy Dog
          and bands like Oasis and Bon Jovi. I could go on and on but the list
          is endless. If you are into magic you can watch magicians like David
          Copperfield do their thing meters from you. Whatever you like, you can
          find it here from Western music to oldies to Jazz, Rock, Heavy Mettle
          to Trance. All you have to do is look at the itenary offered during
          your visit.

          Chinese to Japanese to Korean to Jewish and even Vegetarian and proper
          meat eating establishments await your every delight in Vegas. Do not
          opt for the cheap and oily fried dishes served for free while you
          play. Stop a while and take in the delightful scenery and smells of
          East Asian or European dishes. What is wondrous is that you get to see
          manâ€™s ability to mix. A real melting pot if I may say so myself. But
          is that all what casino cities like Las Vegas are about? Do you have
          to remain in the city to really and truly enjoy your stay? No.
